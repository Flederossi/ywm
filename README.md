# ywm
ywm is a tiny (~85loc) tiling window manager for X11 with a big focus on a lightweight approach. It supports basic functionalities like open a terminal, format the size of the windows as well as manage the aspect ratio between them.
*Note: It is still experimental at this point. Therefore I would not recommend using ywm as your daily use window manager.*
